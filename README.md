# OyoHotel_list_scrapping
This is an R-based data scraping project. The OYO Rooms website has been scraped for information on hotel names, ratings, price per room per night, and amenities provided by each hotel. The website is scraped for the category of hotels in Mumbai city, sorted by guest ratings, and converted to a csv file, which is much easier to extract details from and upload to a database. This project was an attempt by me to learn web scraping in R programming.
